## Misc. Patches

A collection of binary patches in the [Patch32](http://www.kaoteq.com/sites/fravia/fravia-acrigs/FRAVIA/patch_1.htm) `p32` format.

Binary patches are not very useful because specific versions of the applications are often required in order to search for the correct signatures to patch properly.
